# Controller settings
#
# This is the default profile for each controller.
# Multiple controllers slots are defined by increasing the number.
#
# Controller sections contain:
#  Key: A option, these are the same options that can used on the command line
#       but without the "--" prefix.
#  Value: The option's value, should be "true" if no value is needed.

##
# Mappings
#
# Mappings let you map buttons and sticks to mouse, key and joystick events.
#
# Mapping sections always require a name and are then enabled in a profile
# with "mapping = <name>".
#
# Mapping sections contain:
#  Key: A Linux input event, see /usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h for a complete list
#  Value: Button on the DS4, use --dump-reports to see all the available buttons

# Bindings
#
# Bindings let you bind button combos to special built-in actions.

# Binding sections can be defined with a name and are then enabled in a profile

# on all profiles.

#  Key: A button combo
#  Value: An action, see next section for valid actions.

#
# Valid actions:
#  next-profile                                  Loads the next profile
#  prev-profile                                  Loads the previous profile
#  load-profile <profile>                        Loads the specified profile
#  exec <command> [arg1] [arg2] ...              Executes the command with
#                                                specified arguments

#
# Actions will be pre-processed and replace variables with real values.
#
# Valid variables:
#  $profile                The current profile
#  $name                   Pretty name of the current device
#  $device_addr            Bluetooth address of the device
#  $report.<attribute>     Replace <attribute> with a valid attribute,
